            <br>In May of 2024, I was honored to receive a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica, NY.
            <br>I am currently seeking employment opportunities in Software Development that will allow me to continue
            to explore my passion for the tech industry.
